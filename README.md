## This is just a test CSS framework for my personal use.
## A simple classless CSS framework with dark theme.
Simply use your semantic html tags and the page will be styled! 
No need for any classes. 
Note:
This is not a fully fledged CSS framework. It is a simple dark theme with simple styling. 
Use it for prototyping, specially good for blog posts.
