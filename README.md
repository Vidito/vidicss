# vidicss
## This is just a test CSS framework for my personal use.
## A simple classless CSS framework with dark theme.
### Add the following link to your html file under head tag:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vidito/vidicss@1.0/styles.min.css"> 
Simply use your semantic html tags and the page will be styled! 
No need for any classes. 
Note:
This is not a fully fledged CSS framework. It is a simple dark theme with simple styling. 
Use it for prototyping, specially good for blog posts.
